# Project Statement  
## Stress Level Prediction System

### Introduction  
This project focuses on designing a simple and interpretable system that predicts the stress level of a person using basic lifestyle-related features. The goal is to apply object-oriented programming concepts while demonstrating a clear and explainable prediction model.

### Objective  
- To estimate an individual's stress level using measurable factors such as heart rate, sleep duration, and work hours.  
- To implement a readable, maintainable, and modular Python program using OOP principles.  
- To display predictions in a clean, user-friendly format.

### Problem Description  
Stress is influenced by both physiological and behavioral factors. High work hours, low sleep, and elevated heart rate often correlate with increased stress. This project uses these three parameters to produce a stress scor
